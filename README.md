SAP HANA XS Custom (Fiori Like) Launchpad

Problems:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Having HANA XS Engine. ( As Fiori Launchpad plugin not available need for custom Launchpad type app required)</li>
<li>Single entry point was not available for all user or all same role based apps (Landing Page for role based user)</li>
<li>Provide group of tiles on basis of user role. </li>
<li>Getting details of logged in user.</li>
<li>Session management was difficult (Options for Login and Logout).</li>
</ul>

Solution:<br/>
<ul>
<li> Designed UI like Launchpad using unified Shell and other components.</li>
<li>Managed user role on backend using custom table and on basis of user role group of tiles are available on custom Launchpad.</li>
<li>Most important session management done by CSRF token (Debugged HANA XS session and applied same). </li>
</ul>
